# frame_in_a_video
Input .ts (Video) - 10Second  
Input - Frame (Image) - Jpg  
Using the aforementioned files, the program files work together - using the OpenCV Library for Image recognization and Validate Frame accuracy - to print both the frame number of the exact image and the timestamp relative to the video.

Bugs:
  If the image is pixelated compared to the real one then the image will not register.
