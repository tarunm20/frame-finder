# frame_in_a_video
Input .ts (Video) - 10Second  
Input - Frame (Image) - Jpg  
Using the aforementioned files, the program files work together - using the OpenCV Library for Image recognization and Validate Frame accuracy - to print both the frame number of the exact image and the timestamp relative to the video.

Tasks Completed:
  The frames get converted to jpg files.
  There are time stamps, in MS, for all files in one csv file.
  The picture comparison program works with two pictures.
  
Bugs to fix:
  The program doesn't return the frame for the specific video and picture.
